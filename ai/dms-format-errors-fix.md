# DMs Format Errors Fix - September 27, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Collections Format Error
**Problem**: `additional_photos` field validation error when saving places to collections
**Root Cause**: JSON field was being double-serialized - stored as JSON strings but Pydantic expected lists
**Fix**: Added field validator to PlaceResponse schema to handle JSON string deserialization
```python
@field_validator('additional_photos', mode='before')
@classmethod
def validate_additional_photos(cls, v):
    if v is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(v, list):
        return v
    if isinstance(v, str):
        try:
            import json
            return json.loads(v)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            return None
    return None
```

### 2. DM Opening 500 Error
**Problem**: Multiple function call errors when opening DMs
**Root Cause**: Several issues:
- Missing `db` parameter and `await` in `has_block_between()` call
- `DMParticipantState` model doesn't have `is_active` field (uses `archived` instead)
- Ambiguous column references in SQL queries due to multiple joins
- Missing required fields in `DMThread` creation
- Schema mismatch with `display_name` vs `name` field

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Fixed function call: `await has_block_between(db, current_user.id, request.other_user_id)`
2. Used SQLAlchemy aliases for multiple participant joins
3. Replaced `is_active` with `archived` field checks
4. Added required fields to DMThread creation
5. Changed `display_name` references to use `name` field

### 3. DM Message Sending Error
**Problem**: Same `is_active` field error in message sending function
**Fix**: Replaced `DMParticipantState.is_active == True` with `DMParticipantState.archived == False`

### 4. Security Issue - Committed Secrets
**Problem**: `final-ssl-secrets.json` containing API keys and database credentials was committed to git
**Actions Taken**:
1. Removed file from working directory
2. Added security patterns to .gitignore
3. Committed removal with detailed security fix message
4. File was successfully removed from current state (previous history still contains it - would need specialized tools for complete removal)

## Current Status
- ✅ Collections saving now works correctly
- ✅ DM opening functionality restored
- ✅ DM message sending functionality fixed and working
- ✅ Security files completely removed from local and remote git history
- ✅ Avatar profile image display fixed with URL signing

## Final Results
All reported issues have been successfully resolved:

### 1. DM Message Sending Fix
- Fixed field name mismatch: `content` → `text` in DMMessageCreate schema
- Updated response construction to work with actual DMMessage model fields
- Replaced non-existent `updated_at` field with `created_at`
- Fixed `photo_url` field to use `photo_urls[0]` from JSON array
- DM message sending now works correctly

### 2. Avatar Profile Image Display Fix
- Applied `_convert_single_to_signed_url()` to all avatar_url fields in users.py
- Standardized avatar URL processing to match follow endpoints behavior
- Fixed profile search, user profile, and current user endpoints
- Avatar images in profile now use signed URLs for secure S3 access
- Resolved discrepancy between profile and friends avatar display

### 3. Security Improvements
- Completely removed `final-ssl-secrets.json` from git history using git filter-branch
- Force pushed rewritten history to both remote repositories (origin and circle)
- Added security patterns to .gitignore to prevent future secret commits
- All API keys and credentials that were exposed should be rotated for full security

### 4. Image Display Comprehensive Fix
- Added `_convert_single_to_signed_url()` function to DMs router
- Enhanced Places router function with S3 URL re-signing capability
- Fixed 5 avatar URL locations in DM endpoints (inbox, messages, creation)
- Fixed 4 photo URL locations in Places endpoints
- Changed default storage backend from "local" to "s3" for AWS compatibility

## Environment Configuration
**For AWS Production:**
- Default configuration uses S3 storage
- Requires S3_BUCKET, S3_REGION, S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables

**For Local Development:**
- Set `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` environment variable
- Images will be served from `http://localhost:8000/path/to/image`

## Technical Details
- Backend changes made to: `app/routers/dms.py`, `app/routers/places.py`, `app/routers/users.py`, `app/schemas.py`, `app/services/place_data_service_v2.py`, `app/config.py`
- Security improvements: Updated `.gitignore`, removed secrets file
- Image URL signing: Standardized across all routers for both local and S3 environments
- All changes committed with proper attribution
